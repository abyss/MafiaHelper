# MafiaHelper
MafiaHelper is a bot for assisting with running games of Mafia on a Discord server. Your games will still need a moderator. It handles phases of the game (Day and Night, and intermediate phases Dawn and Dusk), voting for lynches, and ending day/night at the end of timer, or ending day when a lynch majority has been reached.

It's fairly simple, and it runs regularly on my server for the Mafia games we run there.
